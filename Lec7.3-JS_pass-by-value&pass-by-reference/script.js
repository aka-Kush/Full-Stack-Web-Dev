//Pass by Value  &  Pass by Reference
/**
 ** Pass by Value:  When we pass a value to a function, a copy of the value is made inside the function and any changes made won't be reflected to the Original value
 ** Pass by Reference:  We pass the pointer to the array which points to the original variables, and any changes made will be reflected to the original variables
