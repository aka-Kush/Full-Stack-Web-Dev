/*Async operations like promises are put into an event queue, which runs after the main thread has finished processing so 
that they do not block subsequent JavaScript code from running. The queued operations will complete as soon as possible then return their 
results to the JavaScript environment. */

//Difference between Asynchronous and Synchronous
/*
* Synchronous basically means that you can only execute one thing at a time. 
* Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don't have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one
